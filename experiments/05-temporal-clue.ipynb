      "On a dark winter night, wealthy and enigmatic Mr. John Q. Boddy hosted a small, but lavish, dinner party for some of his closest associates. However, the night ended in tragedy when Mr. Boddy was found dead in one of the rooms of Tudor Mansion in the early hours of the morning. The following persons of interest have been identified as suspects:\n",

      "• Miss Scarlet\n",
      "• Monsieur Brunette\n",

      "• Knife\n",
      "• Wrench\n",

      "The murder could only have occured in one of the following rooms:\n",

      "• 12:00 AM\n",
      "\n",
      "At every time the suspects and Mr. Boddy either stayed in their current room or moved to an orthogonally adjacent room (north, south, east, or west). Weapons could be moved by suspects between rooms as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the murder to occur, the murderer and Mr. Boddy must have been alone in a room with at least one weapon at some point in the night. Any clue about Mr. Boddy's whereabouts should be read as \"Mr. Boddy (dead or alive) ...\"\n",

      "- The Wrench was in the same room as Monsieur Brunette at 12:00 AM\n",
      "- The murderer and the Wrench were in the Carriage House together at least once\n",
      "- The Knife was in the Carriage House at 12:00 AM if and only if Miss Scarlet was at the Fountain at 11:45 PM\n",
      "- The murder weapon was in the same room as Monsieur Brunette at 11:45 PM\n",
      "- The Wrench was in the Carriage House at 11:45 PM or Monsieur Brunette was in the Carriage House at 11:45 PM\n",
      "- Mr. Boddy was in the room just west of Miss Scarlet at 11:45 PM\n",
      "- The murder weapon was in the Carriage House at 12:00 AM if and only if the murderer was at the Fountain at 11:45 PM\n",
