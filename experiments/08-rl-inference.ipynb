       "Rollout(prompt=\"On a cool autumn afternoon Kennedy, Charles, and Isaac and sat down to play a friendly deduction game.\\n\\nThey assembled 3 groups of cards, each for a different type of data composed of the following:\\n\\nSuspect:\\n- Miss Scarlet\\n- Mr. Green\\n- Mrs. White\\n\\nWeapon:\\n- Candlestick\\n- Knife\\n- Lead Pipe\\n\\nRoom:\\n- Hall\\n- Lounge\\n- Dining Room\\n\\nAfter randomly (and blindly) choosing one card from each group and placing them in the center of the table facedown, they shuffled the remaining cards and dealt out the following to each player:\\n\\n- Kennedy: 2 cards (Hall and Miss Scarlet)\\n- Charles: 2 cards\\n- Isaac: 2 cards\\n\\nThe game proceeded as follows:\\n\\n1. On their turn, a player asked about a set of exactly 3 cards, one from each of the game's categories. (Note: Players could ask about any cards, including those in their own hand.)\\n2. The player directed this question to the other players in clockwise order, starting with the player to their left.\\n3. If a player had one or more of the asked-about cards, they had to show one of those cards (of their choice) to the asking player privately. The turn then ended, and play passed to the next player.\\n4. If a player did not have any of the asked-about cards, they said so, and the question passed to the next player in clockwise order.\\n5. This continued until either:\\na) A player showed a card to the asking player, or\\nb) All the queried players had stated they didn't have any of the asked-about cards.\\n6. After a player's turn ended (either by being shown a card or having all queried players pass), play moved to the next player in clockwise order.\\n\\nHere is how the game played out:\\n\\nKennedy asked if anyone had Miss Scarlet or the Lead Pipe or the Hall:\\n- Charles showed Kennedy the Lead Pipe\\n\\nCharles asked if anyone had Mr. Green or the Candlestick or the Hall:\\n- Isaac did not have any of the cards\\n- Kennedy showed Charles the Hall\\n\\nIsaac asked if anyone had Mr. Green or the Lead Pipe or the Dining Room:\\n- Kennedy did not have any of the cards\\n- Charles showed Isaac a card\\n\\nKennedy asked if anyone had Mr. Green or the Candlestick or the Dining Room:\\n- Charles showed Kennedy Mr. Green\\n\\nCharles asked if anyone had Mr. Green or the Knife or the Lounge:\\n- Isaac showed Charles a card\\n\\nIsaac asked if anyone had Miss Scarlet or the Knife or the Lounge:\\n- Kennedy showed Isaac Miss Scarlet\\n\\nKennedy asked if anyone had Mrs. White or the Candlestick or the Hall:\\n- Charles did not have any of the cards\\n- Isaac did not have any of the cards\\n\\nCharles asked if anyone had Mrs. White or the Candlestick or the Dining Room:\\n- Isaac showed Charles a card\\n\\nIsaac asked if anyone had Mr. Green or the Lead Pipe or the Dining Room:\\n- Kennedy did not have any of the cards\\n- Charles showed Isaac a card\\n\\nKennedy asked if anyone had Miss Scarlet or the Candlestick or the Lounge:\\n- Charles did not have any of the cards\\n- Isaac did not have any of the cards\\n\\nCharles asked if anyone had Mrs. White or the Knife or the Lounge:\\n- Isaac showed Charles a card\\n\\nIsaac asked if anyone had Mrs. White or the Lead Pipe or the Lounge:\\n- Kennedy did not have any of the cards\\n- Charles showed Isaac a card\\n\\nThen, on their turn, Kennedy was able to correctly deduce the solution and win the game.\\n\\nWhat were the facedown cards in the center of the table?\", response=\"Let's analyze the game step by step:\\n\\n1. Kennedy asked if anyone had Miss Scarlet or the Lead Pipe or the Hall:\\n   - Charles showed Kennedy the Lead Pipe.\\n\\nThis means that the Hall is not with Kennedy, and the Lead Pipe is with Charles. So, the Hall cannot be with Charles or Isaac.\\n\\n2. Charles asked if anyone had Mr. Green or the Candlestick or the Hall:\\n   - Isaac did not have any of the cards.\\n   - Kennedy showed Charles the Hall.\\n\\nThis means that the Hall is with Kennedy. The other two cards with Kennedy are Miss Scarlet and the Dining Room (since the Hall is not with Charles or Isaac).\\n\\n3. Isaac asked if anyone had Mr. Green or the Lead Pipe or the Dining Room:\\n   - Kennedy did not have any of the cards.\\n   - Charles showed Isaac a card.\\n\\nThis means that the Lead Pipe is with Charles and the Dining Room is with Isaac. The other two cards with Isaac are Mrs. White and the Lounge.\\n\\n4. Kennedy asked if anyone had Mr. Green or the Candlestick or the Dining Room:\\n   - Charles showed Kennedy Mr. Green.\\n\\nThis means that Mr. Green is with Charles and the Candlestick is with Isaac (since the Dining Room is with Isaac).\\n\\n5. Charles asked if anyone had Mr. Green or the Knife or the Lounge:\\n   - Isaac showed Charles a card.\\n\\nThis means that the Knife is with Isaac and the Lounge is with Kennedy (since Mr. Green is with Charles).\\n\\n6. Isaac asked if anyone had Miss Scarlet or the Knife or the Lounge:\\n   - Kennedy showed Isaac Miss Scarlet.\\n\\nThis means that Miss Scarlet is with Kennedy and the Lounge is with Kennedy (since Miss Scarlet and the Lounge were not with Charles or Isaac).\\n\\n7. Kennedy asked if anyone had Mrs. White or the Candlestick or the Hall:\\n   - Charles did not have any of the cards.\\n   - Isaac did not have any of the cards.\\n\\nThis means that Mrs. White is with Isaac and the Candlestick is with Charles.\\n\\n8. Charles asked if anyone had Mrs. White or the Candlestick or the Dining Room:\\n   - Isaac showed Charles a card.\\n\\nThis means that the Candlestick is with Charles and the Dining Room is with Isaac.\\n\\n9. Isaac asked if anyone had Mr. Green or the Lead Pipe or the Dining Room:\\n   - Kennedy did not have any of the cards.\\n   - Charles showed Isaac a card.\\n\\nThis means that the Lead Pipe is with Charles and the Dining Room is with Isaac.\\n\\n10. Kennedy asked if anyone had Miss Scarlet or the Candlestick or the Lounge:\\n    - Charles did not have any of the cards.\\n    - Isaac did not have any of the cards.\\n\\nThis means that Mrs. White is with Isaac and the Candlestick is with Charles.\\n\\n11. Charles asked if anyone had Mrs. White or the Knife or the Lounge:\\n    - Isaac showed Charles a card.\\n\\nThis means that the Knife is with Isaac and the Lounge is with Kennedy.\\n\\n12. Isaac asked if anyone had Mrs. White or the Lead Pipe or the Lounge:\\n    - Kennedy did not have any of the cards.\\n    - Charles showed Isaac a card.\\n\\nThis means that the Lead Pipe is with Charles and the Lounge is with Kennedy.\\n\\nNow, let's summarize the information:\\n\\n* Hall: Kennedy\\n* Lead Pipe: Charles\\n* Miss Scarlet: Kennedy\\n* Mrs. White: Isaac\\n* Candlestick: Charles\\n* Knife: Isaac\\n* Dining Room: Isaac\\n* Lounge: Kennedy\\n\\nThe facedown cards in the center of the table are:\\n\\n* Suspect: Mrs. White\\n* Weapon: Lead Pipe\\n* Room: Lounge\\n\\nSo, the solution is Mrs. White with the Lead Pipe in the Lounge.\", follow_up='Fill out your answer like this:\\nSuspect: <#SUSPECT#>\\nWeapon: <#WEAPON#>\\nRoom: <#ROOM#>', answer='Suspect: Mrs. White\\nWeapon: Lead Pipe\\nRoom: Lounge', score=0.6666666666666666)"
