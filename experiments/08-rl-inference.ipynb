    "They assembled 3 decks of cards, each for a separate type of information composed of the following:\n",

    "The game proceeded as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. On their turn, a player asked about a set of exactly 3 cards, one from each of the game's categories. (Note: Players could ask about any cards, including those in their own hand.)\n",
    "2. The player directed this question to the other players in clockwise order, starting with the player to their left.\n",
    "3. If a player had one or more of the asked-about cards, they had to show one of those cards (of their choice) to the asking player privately. The turn then ended, and play passed to the next player.\n",
    "4. If a player did not have any of the asked-about cards, they said so, and the question passed to the next player in clockwise order.\n",
    "5. This continued until either:\n",
    "    a) A player showed a card to the asking player, or\n",
    "    b) All the queried players had stated they didn't have any of the asked-about cards.\n",
    "6. After a player's turn ended (either by being shown a card or having all queried players pass), play moved to the next player in clockwise order.\n",
