Roosevelt** is celebrated for his New Deal policies and leadership during World War II.\\n- **Donald Trump** and **John Adams** rank lower based on the criteria evaluated, including leadership challenges and controversies.\\n\\n**Caveats:**\\n\\n- **Subjectivity:** Despite the comprehensive rubric, the evaluation of presidential performance is inherently subjective. Different historians and political scientists may prioritize criteria differently, leading to variations in rankings.\\n- **Historical Context:** Presidents served in vastly different historical contexts, making direct comparisons challenging. The impact of a president’s actions can be interpreted differently over time.\\n- **Evolving Standards:** Societal values and expectations evolve, which can influence the perception of a president’s effectiveness and legacy.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\n\\nThis ranking provides a structured assessment based on the defined rubric, offering a comparative overview of U.S. presidents. It is essential to consider the broader historical and societal contexts when evaluating presidential performance, recognizing that each president faced unique challenges and circumstances.\", refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1738290104, model='o1-mini-2024-09-12', object='chat.completion', service_tier='default', system_fingerprint='fp_f56e40de61', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4456, prompt_tokens=25, total_tokens=4481, completion_tokens_details=CompletionTokensDetails(accepted_prediction_tokens=0, audio_tokens=0, reasoning_tokens=1728, rejected_prediction_tokens=0), prompt_tokens_details=PromptTokensDetails(audio_tokens=0, cached_tokens=0)))"
